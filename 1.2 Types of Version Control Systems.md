# Centralized VCS (CVCS)

## Definition:
- **Centralized Version Control System (CVCS):**
  - A version control system where the entire version history is stored on a central server.

## Characteristics:
1. **Single Repository:**
   - All team members access a single, centralized repository.

2. **Network Dependency:**
   - Requires a constant network connection to access version history and perform version control operations.

3. **Concurrent Access:**
   - Team members can work concurrently, but conflicts may arise, requiring resolution.

4. **History Tracking:**
   - Version history is maintained centrally, and users check out files for editing.

5. **Risk of Data Loss:**
   - Data loss can occur if the central server fails without proper backups.

# Distributed VCS (DVCS)

## Definition:
- **Distributed Version Control System (DVCS):**
  - A version control system where the entire repository, including its history, is cloned on each team member's local machine.

## Characteristics:
1. **Local Repositories:**
   - Each team member has a local copy of the entire repository, including its history.

2. **Network Independence:**
   - Operations can be performed locally without constant network access. Network needed only for synchronization.

3. **Branching and Merging:**
   - Easier and more flexible branching and merging due to the distributed nature.

4. **Reduced Network Load:**
   - Less load on the central server as most operations are performed locally.

5. **Backup and Redundancy:**
   - Every clone is a complete backup, reducing the risk of data loss.

## Examples of DVCS:
- **Git:**
  - A widely used distributed version control system known for its speed and flexibility.

- **Mercurial:**
  - Another DVCS that emphasizes simplicity and ease of use.

Distributed Version Control Systems offer advantages in terms of flexibility, collaboration, and redundancy compared to their centralized counterparts.
